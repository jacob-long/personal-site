# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This study tests the indirect effect of exposure to political satire on political discussion, mediated by talking about political satire (programs). We also test this indirect effect when individuals incidentally exposed to political satire via shared posts on social media. Given the interest of this study, we also test the moderating role of social cohesion dimension of affinity for political humor in the relationship. The results support our predictions. Implications of the findings are discussed."
