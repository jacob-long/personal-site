# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Despite the amount of research on the topic, there are few direct measurements of partisan segregation in media use. Of those that do exist, none are easily transferable to multi-party systems. Using a network analytic approach, I use data from a nationally representative survey of the United States to describe the amount of partisan segregation in media consumption and discuss further applications for these measures."
