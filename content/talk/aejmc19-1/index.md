# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This paper discusses the quality of quantitative communication research in light of the so-called 'replication crisis' that has affected neighboring disciplines. I discuss some of the problems these fields have faced and suggest implementing some of their solutions in communication research. I then argue for greater consideration of generalizability and propose a theoretical framework for assessing the quality of studies suited to a variable field like communication."
