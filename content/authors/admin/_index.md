I am an [Assistant Professor](https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/cic/faculty-staff/long_jacob.php) at
the University of South Carolina's [School of Journalism and Mass
Communications](https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/cic/journalism_and_mass_communications/index.php). 

My research interests are broadly in the area of 
political communication, with special interests in social identity, social 
environments, and the maintenance thereof. I also spend a good deal of my time
thinking about the research designs and analytic methods we can use to learn
more about these things.
