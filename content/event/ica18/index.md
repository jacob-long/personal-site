abstract: For two decades, researchers have investigated the impacts of entertainment
  media that frequently feature political content. In spite of a great deal of empirical
  research, much about these effects remains uncertain. One particularly promising
  line of work has focused on increased internal political efficacy — the sense that
  one is competent to understand and participate in politics — as a potential outcome
  of exposure to political comedy programs. This study uses a nationally representative,
  three-wave panel survey to show strong support for this relationship, providing
  evidence of an indirect causal relationship between political entertainment consumption
  and political participation with internal efficacy serving as mediator. We then
  extend this model by considering the role of political comedy’s “gateway” effect
  in encouraging further political media consumption, which in turn can promote further
  efficacy and participation increases. The data suggest the cumulative effects of
  political comedy consumption on participation, both direct and indirect, are substantial.
