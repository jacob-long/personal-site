abstract: Measuring media exposure is challenging due to apparently unreliable self-reports. 
    As a result, media exposure appears highly stable  after correcting for measurement error. 
    The model commonly used to quantify reliability and stability makes untenable assumptions 
    about the data used in communication. Commonly violated assumptions can bias reliability 
    estimates downward and stability estimates upward. Despite high reported stability, media 
    use changes are associated with theoretically expected outcomes, suggesting more meaningful 
    variation than captured by current methods.
