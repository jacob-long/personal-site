abstract: This study explores the relationship between social network information
  and technological affordances of Facebook in the context of political news exposure
  and discussion. Addressing a gap in previous research in this domain, a focus group
  is used to gain detailed insights about how users consider social information and
  perceive affordances when deciding whether to engage with political content on Facebook.
  A total of 50 undergraduate students were included in the guided discussion. The
  results indicated that individuals generally have a fairly strong distaste for getting
  involved in political discussions on Facebook. They do, however, pay close enough
  attention to the political discourse occurring among friends, family, and acquaintances
  on the site to have distinct impressions of the views of those peers. This ability
  to witness political expression makes Facebook an abundant source of exposure to
  political information and counterattitudinal views among those who otherwise would
  not seek them out. Participants who use multiple social networking sites see their
  network peers on Facebook as uniquely broad and diverse in comparison to other platforms.
  Further implications will be discussed.
