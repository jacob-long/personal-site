abstract: This paper discusses the quality of quantitative communication research
  in light of the so-called 'replication crisis' that has affected neighboring disciplines.
  I discuss some of the problems these fields have faced and suggest implementing
  some of their solutions in communication research. I then argue for greater consideration
  of generalizability and propose a theoretical framework for assessing the quality
  of studies suited to a variable field like communication.
