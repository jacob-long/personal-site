abstract: Despite the amount of research on the topic, there are few direct measurements
  of partisan segregation in media use. Of those that do exist, none are easily transferable
  to multi-party systems. Using a network analytic approach, I use data from a nationally
  representative survey of the United States to describe the amount of partisan segregation
  in media consumption and discuss further applications for these measures.
