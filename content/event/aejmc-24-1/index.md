abstract: This study examines perceptions of AI-generated images used as profile pictures and
    subsequent evaluations of trustworthiness and credibility of someone who uses them. We
    conducted a pre-registered experiment in which participants evaluated profile pictures, some
    of which were AI-generated and some of which were disclosed as such. The comparison set 
    were professional photos. Results indicate that the quality of AI-generated images is rated
    highly, yet disclosure of their AI origins leads to lower quality perceptions.
