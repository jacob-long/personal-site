abstract: This study tests the indirect effect of exposure to political satire on
  political discussion, mediated by talking about political satire (programs). We
  also test this indirect effect when individuals incidentally exposed to political
  satire via shared posts on social media. Given the interest of this study, we also
  test the moderating role of social cohesion dimension of affinity for political
  humor in the relationship. The results support our predictions. Implications of
  the findings are discussed.
