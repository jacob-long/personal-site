abstract: Using the Reinforcing Spirals Model as a framework, this study employed an intensive
    longitudinal design to explore the effects of partisan media use and discussion on variability and
    change in partisan identity. Findings suggest that in-party communication promotes stability by
    reducing variability in identity strength, while also contributing to the strengthening of identity.
    Identity exhibited a tendency to decay among the strongly identified, absent other influences.
    Non-affirming communication, in contrast, was associated with increased variability.
