summary: An expanding collection of tools I originally created to aid in my own research. The unifying theme is the ability to report and visualize the results of regression models.
  Most popular are functions that provide a streamlined, customizable summary of regressions
  (including robust standard error support) in the console, HTML/LaTeX/Word tables,
  and coefficient plots. A few other tools have been described in my blog and elsewhere.
