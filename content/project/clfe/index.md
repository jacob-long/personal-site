summary = "This R package implements a technique from [Allison, Williams, and Moral-Benito (2017)](https://www3.nd.edu/~rwilliam/dynamic/AllisonWilliamsMoralBenito2017.pdf) and the Stata [command](https://www3.nd.edu/~rwilliam/dynamic/SJPaper.pdf) `xtdpdml`. It combines maximum likelihood estimation, the logic of cross-lagged panel models, and the robustness to spuriousness of fixed effects estimators into `dpm`, dynamic panel models. Written with help from Richard Williams and Paul Allison."
