summary: This R package implements a technique from [Allison, Williams, and Moral-Benito
  (2017)](https://www3.nd.edu/~rwilliam/dynamic/AllisonWilliamsMoralBenito2017.pdf)
  and the Stata [command](https://www3.nd.edu/~rwilliam/dynamic/SJPaper.pdf) `xtdpdml`.
  It combines maximum likelihood estimation, the logic of cross-lagged panel models,
  and the robustness to spuriousness of fixed effects estimators into `dpm`, dynamic
  panel models. Written with help from Richard Williams and Paul Allison.
