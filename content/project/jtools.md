summary = "An expanding collection of tools I've created to aid in my own research. The most popular are a set of functions that implement simple slopes analysis, find Johnson-Neyman intervals, and create plots for interaction effects. There are also functions that provide a streamlined, customizable summary of regressions (including robust standard error support) in the console, HTML/LaTeX/Word tables, and coefficient plots. A few other tools have been described in my blog and elsewhere."
