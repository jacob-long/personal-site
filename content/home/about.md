# Biography

I am a PhD student at the School of Communication at <font size="1">[The]</font> 
Ohio State University. My research interests are broadly in the area of 
political communication, with special interests in social identity, social 
environments, and the maintenance thereof. I also spend a good deal of my time
thinking about the research designs and analytic methods we can use to learn
more about these things.
