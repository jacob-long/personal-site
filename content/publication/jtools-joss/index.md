abstract: "`jtools` is an R package designed to ease the exploration and presentation of regression models with a focus on the needs of social scientists. Most notably, it generates results summaries that are meant to provide some of the conveniences of commercial software such as Stata (e.g., calculating robust standard errors and integrating them into a results table). Additionally, `jtools` includes plotting functions to help users better understand and share the results and predictions from fitted regression models."
