abstract: This paper discusses the assessment of quality of quantitative communication
  research in light of the so-called ‘replicability crisis’ that has affected neighboring
  disciplines. For social scientific research, it is useful to think of research results
  as estimates which include error. I propose a framework suited to a variable field
  like communication, factoring in all sources of error, for assessing the quality
  of research. In communication research, greater consideration of generalizability
  is essential, which is at once both a higher standard than replicability but also
  a goal that should increase it. Furthermore, more explicit discussion of generalizability
  may help to further internationalize the discipline by clarifying the limitations
  of the large portion of research conducted within a narrow subset of world cultures.
