abstract: This study integrates and builds upon research on moral psychology, entertainment
  media selection, and political communication that has established a link between
  political ideology and moral sentiments. An automated content analysis of the lyrics
  of 37,309 songs across 10 genres assessed the extent of appeals to five different
  moral domains defined by Moral Foundations Theory. The results of the content analysis
  are integrated with nationally-representative survey data (N = 1000) by linking
  lyrical content with self-reported preference for and exposure to musical genres.
  We then correlate the content of preferred genres with self-reported moral sentiments
  and political ideology. We find the moral content of music lyrics in the genres
  used by respondents is associated with their moral preferences and political ideology.
