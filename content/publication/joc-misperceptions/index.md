abstract: This article provides evidence that affective polarization is an important
  mechanism linking conservative media use to political misperceptions. Partisan mediaâ€™s
  potential to polarize is well documented, and there are numerous ways in which hostility
  toward political opponents might promote the endorsement of inaccurate beliefs.
  We test this mediated model using data collected via nationally representative surveys
  conducted during two recent U.S. presidential elections. Fixed effects regression
  models using three-wave panel data collected in 2012 provide evidence that conservative
  media exposure contributes to more polarized feelings toward major-party presidential
  candidates, and this growing favorability gap is associated with misperceptions
  critical of the Democrats. Further, these effects are more pronounced among Republicans
  than among Democrats. Cross-sectional analyses using data collected in 2016 provide
  additional evidence of the mediated relationship. The theoretical and real-world
  significance of these results are discussed.
