abstract: Despite a great deal of research, much about the effects of political comedy
  programming on its viewers remains uncertain. One promising line of work has focused
  on increased internal political efficacy — the sense that one is competent to engage
  with politics — as an outcome of exposure to political comedy programs. This may
  explain results showing that viewers are more likely to participate in politics.
  We extend this approach by considering the role of political comedy’s “gateway”
  effect in encouraging political media consumption, which can promote additional
  increases in efficacy and participation. This study provides a theoretical synthesis
  of prior research and a rigorous empirical test using a representative panel survey
  of adults in the United States, providing evidence of a relationship between political
  comedy and participation with both news use and internal efficacy serving as mediators.
  Furthermore, we find that only political satire, not late-night talk shows, appear
  to produce these effects.
