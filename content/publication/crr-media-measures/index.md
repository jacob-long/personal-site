abstract: "Measuring communication is among the most difficult and consequential issues in the
    discipline. Even the most promising methods tend to have serious drawbacks in terms of
    feasibility, accuracy, or scope. This study develops two brief questionnaire measures to assess
    the frequency and partisan orientation of political media exposure and discussion. Addressing the
    challenge of accurate self-reporting in survey research, especially under time constraints,
    cognitive interviews were conducted to refine the measures. Initial quantitative validity evidence
    suggests moderate correlations with related constructs, indicating the measures' potential utility
    in capturing meaningful variation in political communication behaviors."
