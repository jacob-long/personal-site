abstract: There is growing concern about the polarizing impact of citizens primarily
  choosing sources of political information consistent with their existing partisan
  perspective. While research has begun providing answers about the consequences,
  questions remain about what factors drive such selective use of political media.
  This study conceptualizes partisanship as a social identity and the decision to
  selectively use likeminded political media as a method for maintenance of that identity.
  Using the logic of the Reinforcing Spirals Model (Slater, 2007, 2015), we investigated
  partisan media selectivity as a response to identity threat. We argue the partisan
  composition of one’s geographic locale and the presence of partisan difference in
  one’s interpersonal network are common causes of identity threat, which we predict
  will be associated with compensatory use of partisan media. Results from national
  survey data generally provide support for the assertion that greater partisan media
  selectivity is associated with the presence of various forms of identity threat,
  especially for strong partisans.
